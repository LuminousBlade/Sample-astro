# My First Blog Post

Published on : 01-08-2023

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning: 

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my new files.
1. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by new Astro files.
1. **Making a Blog Post**: And here I am with my new first blog post.

## What's next
 
I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Stay tuned!
